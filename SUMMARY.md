# Summary

## What was I able to accomplish?

- Connect with API and fetch data
- Parse data and group posts by user
- Implement loading spinner
- Add button to details (expanding html tag) to set the selected user
- Set repo up for continuous integration (deploys to live site triggered each time code is pushed to the repo) - ***not assigned***

## What would I do next time if I had more time?

- Finish implementing Redux (I started, but ran out of time)
- Implement tests (zero done here)
- Clean up and light refactoring
