# Business Rules

## React Exercise

**Please limit your time working on this exercise to four hours.**

Please create a React and Redux application implementing the following feature: displaying blog post data from the following web service:

<https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts>

- Display the posts for the current user in the left column, and posts for all other users in the right column. For the purposes of this exercise, you can hard-code the “current user ID” to 1.
- Handle both loading and error states.
- Cover all the important behavior of the code with automated tests. Feel free to choose between end-to-end tests and unit/component tests.
- Add enough CSS to get the left/right column layout and make it look clean, but don’t worry about too fancy styling.
